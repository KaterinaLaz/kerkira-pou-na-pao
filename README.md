# Κέρκυρα – Πού να πάω; 🍝

A simple, personal web guide with my favorite spots for food, coffee, and drinks in **Corfu**.  
Not a tourist guide. Not a “Top 10” list. Just hand-picked places I’ve visited, enjoyed, and would happily go to again.

## 🎯 Scope

This project is intended as a **personal and informal guide** for:
- Locals in Corfu looking for relaxed, authentic spots.
- Friends and acquaintances who ask for recommendations.
- Visitors who want to avoid overcrowded tourist areas.

It is **not**:
- A commercial directory.
- A review aggregator.
- A complete list of every restaurant, café, or bar in Corfu.

The focus is on **quality over quantity**, with each entry personally tested and recommended.
